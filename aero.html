								<h2 style="color:black">AEROMODELLING ROCKS!</h2>
							</header>

							<h3 style="color:black"><span class="image left"><img src="images/rcp1.jpg" alt="" /></span>I have developed this hobby after I came to the college. I always
							had interest in the aerial vehicles which led me to perticipate in the flagship event of Aeromodelling Club IITB and definitely the most fun competition of
							1st year : RC Plane 2018, in which we had to make our own plane and fly that. It is one of the best memory I had in my freshie year. The click alongside is of
							my team with my 1st ever plane. Although our flight wasn't smooth and didn't go according to the plan, I managed to execute a barrel roll, and I still am proud of it!</h3>
							<h3 style="color:black"><span class="image right"><img src="images/team.jpg" alt="" /></span>In the 2nd semester I joined the Aeromodelling Club where I met one
							of the most humble people I've met. I along with my co-conveners and volunteers will be handling the Aeromodelling events in the year 2019-2020. The team really works
						 	as a single unit as we practiced designing and contructing rc planes and also worked on our flying skills. I hope this tenure to be a beautiful one and in which I
							learn a lot of skills related to aeromodelling. The present team consists of Savneek Bhatia (Manager), Aman Malekar, Shivendra Kumar, Parth Tawarawala, Raghav Gupta,
							Vedanth Sharma, Akhilesh Kumar, Pranav K Das, Sanjeev Vishnu, Shaktiswaraj Sahoo Shubham Lohiya and me.</h4>
							<h3 style="color:black"><span class="image left"><img src="images/spx.jpg" alt="" /></span> The thing which drove me into Aeromodelling activities is the fascinating
							topic of Rocket Science. Along with building and flying planes, I would like to learn more about this field. I've been following the activities of SpaceX since 2014
							as I found the idea of reusable rockets absolutely amazing. And now look at them. My ultimate goal of life is to contribute to the very idea Elon Musk has to colonize Mars.
							Becuase if we call ourselves the smartest of the living beings in the universe (which we are definitely not) we need to be one of the multi-planetary species. Who knows what we
							can achieve after that. Space travel? To distant galaxies? Yeah, ambitious ideas, but first we need to take the step of colonizing Mars first. </h3>
