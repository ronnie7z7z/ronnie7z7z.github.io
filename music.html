								<p>Ten Thousand Promises, Ten Thousand Ways To Lose...</p>
								<h2 style="color:black">MUSIC IS MY ESCAPE</h2>
							</header>

							<h3 style="color:black"><span class="image left"><img src="images/original.jpg" alt="" /></span>My never-ending love for music exists since I was nine.
							First of the bands/artists I was introduced to were Linkin Park, Green Day, Eminem, Simple Plan and others. I quickly developed interest in Rock and Rap music. My favourite genre
						 	is Alternative Rock and I've discovering many new artists recently (They're new to me :P). Skillet, All Time Low, Bring Me The Horizon, Joyner Lucas are some of them which
							I feel are way too underrated in spite of their awesome work. You can check them out if you want to!</h3>
							<h3 style="color:black"><span class="image right"><img src="images/364.jpg" alt="" /></span>I play a couple of instruments too. I'm a begginer at keys although I've performed twice
							in front of audience. I started drumming after I joined college and learnt it at a okayish level in the first semester. The click alongside is a pic from a band performance of me and
							some of my friends in a competition in our college. We won 4th position out of 18 teams thanks to the extra-ordinary performance by our band's vocalist Harmeet Saluja. Love you man!</h3>
							<h3 style="color:black"><span class="image left"><img src="images/emi.jpg" alt="" /></span> In my 14-16s Rap music had me overwhelmed. Especially Eminem's songs
							felt relatable and also freaking awesome! I had a Rap-Fever at this time as I learned to rap almost 16 of his songs word-to-word. 25 To Life, Love The Way You Lie, Lose Yourself, Fast Lane, No Love were some
							of them. Alphabet Aerobics by Blackalicious and the super-sonic speed verse in Rap God are the two tracks I usually rap when someone asks me to. </h3>
